This repository is a bit strange, because we constantly rebase on dnschneid/crouton
(merging modifications would be even more difficult, as we renamed files and
git-merge is very confused...)...

That means you need to do the following to fetch modifications from the tree:
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

Be careful, as this will erase any other commit you did in your own master branch.

====
Rebasing is done as follows (you need to be in the master branch):

git pull origin lastcrouton

# Save a copy of the old branch, just in case:
git branch -f master-base-`cat .git/refs/tags/lastcrouton`
git push origin master-base-`cat .git/refs/tags/lastcrouton`

git fetch --all
git rebase crouton/master

Now inspect the last modifications in crouton:

git format-patch lastcrouton..crouton/master

This create a set of 00XX-YYY.patch, that you can have a look at, one by one, and apply
them in the arch directories.

git tag -f lastcrouton crouton/master
git push -f origin lastcrouton

git commit --allow-empty -m "Rebase on crouton/`cat .git/refs/tags/lastcrouton`"
git push -f origin master
